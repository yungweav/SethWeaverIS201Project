                                <br>
                                <p>My church is very important to me. I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints my entire life. It is a good church, founded exactly after the manner of Christ's original New Testament Church, including being led by a prophet and twelve apostles. 
                                    I love how it has helped me become a disciple of Jesus Christ. Following Jesus Christ has helped me develop abilities such as patience and kindness, which have helped me in my family and business relationships. Striving to emulate Christ has helped me develop a good work ethic,
                                    and character traits such as honesty, and responsability. I chose to serve a two year proselyting mission, where I taught others of Jesus Christ and invited them to follow Him like I do, so they can enjoy these same blessings. I served in Peru, learning Spanish, and then finished my
                                    time in the North Eastern States, in Maryland and Pennsylvania. Experiencing these diffierent cultures really helped me appreciate the many different talents and gifts that each person and culture has. Everyone is a child of God, and it is His plan and goal that we all return to live with Him and 
                                    our families. What a great blessing! This is why I strive to be a disciple of Jesus Christ each and every day. If you have any questions see my contact page and reach out!
